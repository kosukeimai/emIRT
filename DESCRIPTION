Description: Various Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms are implemented for item 
	response theory (IRT) models. The package includes IRT models for binary and ordinal
	responses, along with dynamic and hierarchical IRT models with binary responses. The
	latter two models are fitted using variational EM.  The package also includes 
	variational network and text scaling models.  The algorithms are described in Imai, Lo, 
	and Olmsted (2016) <DOI:10.1017/S000305541600037X>.
