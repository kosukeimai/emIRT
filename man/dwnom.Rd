  Poole-Rosenthal DW-NOMINATE data and scores, 80-110 U.S. Senate
}

\description{

  This data set contains materials related to the Poole-Rosenthal DW-NOMINATE measure of senator
  ideology.  The software (and other materials) is available at \url{ftp://voteview.com/dw-nominate.htm},
  which includes a simpler example of an application to the 80-110 U.S. Senate.  The data set here is
  derived from the data and estimates from that example, but are formatted to be run in \code{hierIRT()}.
  In particular, start values for estimation are identical to those provided by the example.

\usage{
data(dwnom)
}

\value{

  \item{dwnom}{ list, containing the following elements:
    \itemize{
    \item{\code{data.in}}{ Legislator voting data, formatted for input to \code{hierIRT()}.}
    \item{\code{cur}}{ Start values, formatted for input to \code{hierIRT()}. }
    \item{\code{priors}}{ Priors, formatted for input to \code{hierIRT()}.}
    \item{\code{legis}}{ data frame, containing contextual information about the legislators estimated.}
    \item{\code{nomres}}{ data frame, containing estimates from DW-NOMINATE on the same data. These
      are read from the file SL80110C21.DAT. }

### Real data example of US Senate 80-110 (not run)
### Based on voteview.com example of DW-NOMINATE 
### We estimate a hierarchical model without noise and a linear time covariate
### This model corresponds very closely to the DW-NOMINATE model
